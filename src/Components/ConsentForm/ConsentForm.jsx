              If you agree to participate, you will engage in a series of
              creative thinking tasks, some with assistance from an AI tool and
              some without. The purpose of this study is to explore how AI tools
              affect your ability to generate ideas and think creatively. You
              will also be asked to complete short surveys before and after the
              tasks to share your thoughts on the experience. The entire session
              will take about 30 minutes.

              time, and it will not be held against you. Withdrawal from study
              or failure to participate will not have any academic consequences

              there are no risks to your student career. However, compensation
              for the study will depend on completing the full study.
