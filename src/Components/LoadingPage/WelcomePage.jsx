        experiment, you will complete a series of tasks designed to explore
        different ways of generating ideas. Your input is valuable, and there
        are no right or wrong answersâ€”just focus on being creative!

        <p>
          In this task, you are not allowed to use AI tools. Think of as many
          alternative uses for the given object as possible within 3 minutes.
          For each idea, include a one-sentence explanation of the rationale
          behind its creative use.
